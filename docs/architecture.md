# Architecture

## Workspace Structure

`sysml` is a Cargo workspace with 12 crates. The `sysml-core` library is the foundation — all domain crates depend only on it. No domain crate depends on any other domain crate.

```
crates/
  sysml-core/         Core library (parser, model, checks, simulation, codegen)
  sysml-cli/          CLI frontend (clap, command dispatch, output formatting)
  sysml-verify/       Verification domain
  sysml-scaffold/     Scaffolding and template generation
  sysml-risk/         Risk management
  sysml-tol/          Tolerance analysis
  sysml-bom/          Bill of materials
  sysml-source/       Supplier management
  sysml-mfg/          Manufacturing execution
  sysml-qc/           Quality control
  sysml-capa/         Quality management (NCR, CAPA, Process Deviation)
  sysml-report/       Cross-domain reporting
libraries/            Domain library .sysml files
tree-sitter-sysml/    Grammar (git submodule)
test/fixtures/        SysML v2 test files
```

## sysml-core

The core library has no CLI dependencies and is frontend-agnostic.

```

```

## Design Principles

**Model vs Records vs Tool**: SysML files define types and structure. TOML records capture operational data (what happened, when, by whom). The tool provides execution logic, validation, and reporting.

**Flat command namespace**: All commands are top-level (`sysml risk matrix`, not `sysml lifecycle risk matrix`). Designed for non-software engineers who shouldn't need to memorize a command hierarchy.

**No cross-domain crate dependencies**: Domain crates communicate through the shared cache and record system in `sysml-core`. This keeps compile times fast and prevents circular dependencies.

**Git-native records**: Append-only TOML records use filenames that encode timestamp + author + hash, making merge conflicts impossible. Entity records use `BTreeMap` for deterministic key ordering.

**Progressive enhancement**: The tool works with zero configuration for pure SysML v2 analysis. The `.sysml/` project, cache, records, and domain libraries are opt-in.
