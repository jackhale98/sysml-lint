sysml works with SysML v2 models in textual notation.

SysML v2 is the next-generation systems modeling language from OMG. It uses \
a textual notation where 'definitions' declare reusable types (part def, port def, \
action def, etc.) and 'usages' create instances of those types within a context.

GETTING STARTED:
  Validate a model:       sysml lint model.sysml
  List model elements:    sysml list --kind parts model.sysml
  Show element details:   sysml show model.sysml Vehicle
  Generate a diagram:     sysml diagram -t bdd -o mermaid model.sysml
  Simulate a state machine: sysml simulate state-machine model.sysml
  Add to a model:         sysml add model.sysml part-def Vehicle --doc 'A vehicle'
  Interactive wizard:     sysml add
  Remove from a model:    sysml remove model.sysml Engine
  Format a file:          sysml fmt model.sysml
  Export to FMI:          sysml export interfaces model.sysml --part MyPart
